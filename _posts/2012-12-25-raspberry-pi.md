After waiting for more then a month my [Raspberry Pi](www.raspberrypi.org) finally arrived last week. Its a great piece of hardware at a great price, as always I am not really clear on what all I am going to do with it, initial plan was a Media Center running XBMC for the TV, I live in a rented apartment which I am sharing with some friends, we have an old 21" CRT TV which does not have any input source like VGA/HDMI, so the RCA composite video connector on Raspberry Pi made a lot of sense.

To power it I am using the charger I got with my Galaxy Tab which has a nice 5 Volt - 2 Ampere output which should be more then sufficient for what i have planned

* Home Automation using the GPIO pins
* Different kinds of Bots
* 1 Player [Foosball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_football)
* [Solar-Powered FTP server](http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/desktops/how-to-make-a-raspberry-pi-solar-powered-ftp-server-50009923/) \(well not really but super cool idea\)

Since it boots directly through an SD card converting it from one project to other is really easy, currently I have 2 configurations on 2 saperate SD cards, one with XBMC \([Raspbmc](http://www.raspbmc.com/)\) streaming to TV from my NAS and other with [Arch Linux](http://archlinuxarm.org) for testing out different server/service configuration
